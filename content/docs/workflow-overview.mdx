# HTTP Workflow

The HTTP Workflow is designed to facilitate the integration of your existing Application APIs with the Maxim platform without requiring any code integrations at your end. This workflow is particularly useful for mapping your application’s API endpoint to Maxim. We also provide a playground for you to try the workflow and map the output based on the response from your application before you start testing. Read more on HTTP workflow here.

Example usecase : If you have a chatbot you would typically have a frontend and backend and they would be talking to each other using a rest API. You can just bring that api here and start triggering the api in the playground with a input. 

Once you trigger the run button it will hit your endpoint with the input provided and fetch the API response. You can then configure what you want to evaluate from the response json and then we can get started with evaluating that part of the response.

Once saved we can trigger a test run in the workflow. 

The HTTP Workflow in Maxim operates similarly to API testing tools like Postman, making it intuitive for developers to use and test their end to end AI application with just a few click.
