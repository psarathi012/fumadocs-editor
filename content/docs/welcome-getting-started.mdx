## Add model API keys

You can start by adding your API keys in the model config. To add model config go to settings â†’ Model Config and choose your provider.

## Create a dataset

Once you have added the model API keys and sent invitations, you can begin <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>creating a test dataset</code></a>. A sample dataset will also be available, which you can access from the "Datasets" tab in the left navigation bar.

## Create a prompt or a workflow
You can then start creating a <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>workflow</code></a> or a <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>prompt</code></a>. Additionally, a sample workflow will be available for exploration in the "Workflows" tab located in the left navigation bar.

## Add evaluators to a workflow
After creating the workflow, you can start testing by clicking the test button on the top right hand side of the workflow. On clicking the test button a right side panel appears where you have the option to add <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>evaluators</code></a> and choose a dataset for testing. Additionally, you can also initiate testing with the sample workflow, which already includes some evaluators and has an attached dataset.

## Trigger a test run
Upon completing the aforementioned steps, you can initiate a test run for either the <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>prompt</code></a>  or the <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>workflow</code></a>  you have created. Additionally, you have the option to initiate a test run directly from the sample workflow.
