- **Copy and Paste:** Easily replicate data by copying and pasting rows within the dataset.
- **Add Rows:** Quickly add new rows to the dataset for additional data entries.
- **Move Columns:** Arrange columns by moving them to different positions within the dataset.
- **Delete Columns:** Remove unnecessary columns from the dataset as needed.
- **Delete Datasets:** Remove entire datasets when they are no longer required.
- **Duplicate Datasets:** Create copies of datasets to preserve and work with multiple versions efficiently.

These features provide enhanced flexibility and ease of data management in Maxim AI.
