In the above you can see two prompts chained together

1. Prompt 1: Given a travel itinerary model should do a function call (use Prompt tool which is configured) and return the travel cost from one city to another (example explained in <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="">`Prompt tools`</a>)
2. Prompt 2: After obtaining the travel cost from the previous prompt, it should generate a reimbursement letter to HR, including the travel cost details.

Then you can run the prompt sequence by entering user input on the right side of the panel.

In this example, the model first calculates the travel cost from Paris to Madrid, then from Madrid to London, and finally from London to Barcelona `Prompt 1`. Subsequently, the model drafts an email to HR requesting reimbursement and includes the total travel cost `Prompt 2`.

You can evaluate the prompt chain outputs using the <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="">`evaluators`</a> and review the reports from <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="">`Runs`</a>.
