To add images you will have to:

- Add a new column in your dataset.
- Select the column type as "image".
- Paste the image URL into the column.
- The image will be rendered once the URL is read.

You need to add two additional columns since "input" and "expected output" columns are default. One column should be of type "image" and another should be of type "variable".

When importing data from the example mentioned above, you will need to map the columns by specifying which column should serve as the input and which one should be designated as the expected output and map the other columns to their respective types as well.

# Upload CSV file

Once uploaded, you can view the dataset. From there, you can rearrange columns, delete columns, add rows, or duplicate the dataset as needed.
