```py title="flask.py"
from flask import Flask

# Flask constructor takes the name of 
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/rag',methods=['POST'])
def rag_output():
    body = request.get_json()
    print(body)
    output = runPrompt(body['query'])
    response = {'response':output}
    return response

# main driver function
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # run() method of Flask class runs the application 
    # on the local development server.
    app.run()
```
In this example, we have built a demo RAG application using `Googleâ€™s PaLM` model based on `"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - CHAPTER ONE"`. The application is served locally through a Flask endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/rag`.

To test your endpoint outputs on Maxim AI, you need a public API. You can achieve this by using `Ngrok`, which makes the endpoint public through tunneling.

# Setup Ngrok
You can follow these steps or refer to the <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/">`Ngrok`</a> documentation.

To install Ngrok on a Mac, use the following command:

```shell 
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```
Next, connect your `Ngrok` agent to your Ngrok account. If you haven't already, sign up for an Ngrok account and copy your `authtoken` from your Ngrok dashboard.

Run the following command in your terminal to install the authtoken and connect the Ngrok agent to your account:
```shell 
ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>
```
Start `Ngrok` by running the following command.

```shell 
ngrok http http://localhost:5000

```
We assume you have a working web application listening at `http://localhost:5000` If your app is listening on a different URL, adjust the command accordingly.

You will see something similar to the following console UI in your terminal.

You can now take this forwarding URL and use it in our platform by following the steps mentioned in <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/">`Bring your application to Maxim`</a>
