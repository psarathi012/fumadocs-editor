title: Use prompt tools in prompt

# Adding prompt tool in the prompt configuration
You can create a prompt tool in Maxim in two ways:

To use the Prompt tool:

1. Navigate to the single prompt section.
2. Choose or create a new prompt
3. Choose and add a prompt tool in the prompt configuration.

For this example we will use the prompt tool that we have built in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling"><code>Create a prompt tool</code></a>

  You can also add a prompt tool to the prompt configuration for a selected prompt in multiple prompt

# Running the prompt configured with prompt tool

When in the system prompt instruction is given - “you are an expert travel accountant get all the city names from the user input and maintain the order and do call the function to give a total price”.

In the user prompt  we mention a list of travel destinations, the LLM automatically recognizes the need to employ the "Total_Travel_Price" Prompt tool and returns the calculated total fare price.

The calculated total fare amounts to $14,691. This amount can then be used as needed; for example, it can be provided as input to the model to compose a letter addressed to the HR department, formally requesting reimbursement.

You can attach multiple prompt tools to an individual prompt to validate the model's ability to recognise user input and appropriately select the correct prompt tool to execute
