title: Testing a prompt
description: You can execute test runs for prompts in two different ways, you can trigger a test from Prompt chain or from Single prompt.
---

In Single Prompt, once you have set up the system prompt, user prompt, and added the necessary configurations and context, you can go to the top right corner and click <code>Test</code>. 

Similarly, once you have set up a prompt chain, you can again go to the top right corner and click <code>Test</code>.

Then you can follow these steps which are consistent across both the Single Prompt and Prompt Chain flow:

<Steps>
<Step>
  ***Add a dataset.***
</Step>
 
<Step>
  ***Add evaluators from the evaluator store.***
</Step>
<Step>
***Toggle on the evaluators you want to test the workflow on.***
</Step>
<Step>
 ***Finally, click "Trigger Test Run."***
</Step>
<Step>
 ***If you have chosen human evaluators you would be prompted to enter the emails of the human raters.***
</Step>
</Steps>

You can also access the report for each test run in the <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>Runs</code></a> tab.
