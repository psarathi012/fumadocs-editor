# Programmatic Evaluators
 In Maxim, you can construct Programmatic Evaluators akin to how API-based evaluators are created. These evaluators are code snippets designed to validate specific criteria, such as checking for a particular keyword or verifying a correct email address. 
 
## Creating a new workspace
You can create a new workspace by selecting the workspace dropdown in the top right corner of the screen. Click on the  <code>+ Create Workspace</code> button to create a new workspace.

## Deleting a workspace
You can delete a workspace by going into the Settings > Workspace Info. Once deleted, you will not be able to recover the workspace and all the data associated with it will be lost.

# Account settings
You can head over to the account settings option from the main menu on the top-right to manage your account and workspace-level settings. You can update account-specific information, for example: account info, members, model configurations, and Maxim API keys directly from the portal. You can also update workspace settings such as workspace name.

## Roles
In Maxim, we have enabled fine-grained RBAC (Role Based Access Control) where you can create custom roles and specify granular access permissions per role for each feature on the platform. By default, we have a few roles and permissions pre-populated for you such as super admin, admin, contributors, etc. You can modify these roles to suit your needs. This allows for precise control over user capabilities within the platform.

## Members
Here you can see all members of your teams who have been invited to the account. You can invite team members to specific workspaces and assign them roles accordingly.

## Model config

At Maxim we support all open and closed source models and your own custom models through model Providers. We support almost all major model providers:

- OpenAI
- Microsoft Azure
- Google
- Anthropic
- Hugging Face
- Together
- AWS Bedrock
- Groq

We are also adding other model providers based on user requests. 

To use your desired model you can get started by adding your API keys in the model config under the respective model providers.
