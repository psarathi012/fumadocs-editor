# Context sources

To test your RAG pipeline itâ€™s very important to evaluate the retrieved context along with evaluating the final generated output. We allow you to bring your retrieved context using an HTTP workflow. Read more about context sources <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling"><code>here</code></a>.

# Prompt tools

Being able to attach function calling to prompts ensures you can test your actual application flow mimicking agentic workflows in your real application. Read more about prompt tools <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling"><code>here</code></a>.

# Custom models

At Maxim you can create and update datasets and these datasets keep evolving as you navigate through the lifecycle of the application.
