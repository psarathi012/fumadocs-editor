In the above picture, you can see two prompts chained together

1. Prompt 1: Given a travel itinerary model should call do a `function call` (use Prompt tool which is configured) and return the travel cost from one city to another (example explained in <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com">`Prompt Tool`</a>

2. Prompt 2: After obtaining the travel cost from the previous prompt, it should generate a reimbursement letter to HR, including the travel cost details.

Then you can run the prompt sequence by entering `user input` on the right side of the panel.

In this example, the model first calculates the travel cost from Paris to Madrid, then from Madrid to London, and finally from London to Barcelona `(Prompt 1)`. Subsequently, the model drafts an email to HR requesting reimbursement and includes the total travel cost `(Prompt 2)`.

Prompt chains also support image inputs

In the above example, two prompts are chained together to create a Prompt chain. The first prompt processes an `image input` and generates a description of the image as output. This output is then passed to the second prompt, which uses the description to generate a quirky caption.
