title: Share test run report
---

Once a test run is completed, you can view the report from the "Runs" tab. These reports are easily shareable via a simple share link, making it convenient to collaborate and communicate with your team or external stakeholders. The shared report can also be opened by people who are not added to the platform thus ensuring seamless collaboration with external stakeholders.
