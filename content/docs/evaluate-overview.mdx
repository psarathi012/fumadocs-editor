## Prompts

With prompts the idea was to go beyond the traditional simple playground approach that a lot of the platforms have today. We have created a experience that mimics your real application workflow including attaching prompt tools (function call) and allowing you to bring your own rag context and having dynamic variables in prompts that change at runtime.. Therefore we have created what we believe is playground++ which is a prompt IDE with CMS. Apart from that we also have enabled bulk prompt experimentation for helping you with prompt and model choices. We also have built out prompt chains to mimic your Chain Of Thought (COT).

## Workflows

Workflows at maxim have been built to enable you to test your application end to end. We have built a HTTP workflow very similar to that of postman. You can bring your application endpoint, configure the parameters and get started with testing your application all in just a few clicks.

## Runs

The runs tab is where you can see all your previous or current test run reports. This is the tab where you will be able to look at test reports and figure out the areas where your application is doing well and areas where they need improvement. We would also be able to track how your application have evolved over time by looking at comparison runs and previous test run reports of your application. There are a ton of other powerful capabilities that test run reports unlock. Read more about it <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com"><code>here</code></a>
