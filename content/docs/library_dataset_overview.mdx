At Maxim we have a robust datasets capabilty for evaluation and fine-tuning. Datasets are very critical for AI application development, but creating, updating, and managing datasets entails a lot of manual effort and is a big overhead for development teams. Maximâ€™s dataset management engine makes it simple for you and your teams to easily create, update, and manage data sets throughout your development lifecycle.

# Importing Datasets

We have created the dataset on the platform so as to allow you to import your existing dataset on the platform with just a click of a button. We enable you to map your dataset columns to maxim dataset column entities to ensure a smooth data management and testing experience.

# **Updating datasets**

The data sets you create are not static entities in Maxim. We want you to evolve those over the course of your application lifecycle. if you are pushing logs to Maxim using our SDK if you setup automated workflows to update your evaluation datasets or finetuning datasets based on any metadata like User feedback. This seamless data pipeline allows you to evolve your test sets so that you are progressively evaluating your workflows on more challenging relevant and upto date data.

# Multimodal datasets

In Maxim, datasets can have columns of the following types (entities):

- **Input (Compulsory entity):** A column associated with this type means it would be treated as input query to test your application
- **Expected Output:** Data representing the desired or intended response that the application should aim to generate to the corresponding input.
- **Image:** You can upload images or just have URL of the image.
- **Variables:** Any data that you would want to dynamically change in prompts/workflow during runtime.
- Expected tool calls: prompt tools that are expected to get triggered for the corresponding input

# Excel-like capabilities

We have created the dataset keeping in mind peoples experience with popular tools like Excel or google spreadsheets. We have enabled all such operations on our datasets.

- Flexible like excel , bring or create any number of columns
