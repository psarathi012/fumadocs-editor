title: Prompts
description: Prompt engineering is a fundamental aspect of AI development, and Maxim AI offers a comprehensive platform to facilitate this process. With Maxim AI, you can create and refine prompts, do bulk experiments over large test suites  in a playground environment, and seamlessly incorporate them into your environment (e.g., production or staging). Additionally, you can  monitor their quality in production and evolve them over time. Our mission is to deliver an exceptional authoring experience, ensuring that prompts are integrated into your environment smoothly, securely, and reliably. Maxim AI also enables you to connect prompts with your data, RAG pipelines, and prompt tools , enhancing integration and operational efficiency.

At Maxim, you can experiment with your prompts in three distinct ways:
# Single Prompt 
Customize your `system` and `user prompts`, and evaluate them by executing a  <a style={{color:"#FFA500"}} href="https://www.w3schools.com">`test run`</a>.

# Prompt Experiment
Assess the performance of `multiple prompts` across `different models` or `multiple prompts` for a `single model`.

# Prompt Chain 
Sequentially layer prompts by chaining them together, and evaluate the final output by triggering a test run.
